# Plank Separator

This script allows you to create seperators for the Plank dock. Available seperators include a blank space, a white bar and a black bar. All three come in both vertical and horizontal variants. 

The script copies itself and its files into plank's data directory at ~/.local/share/plank/plank-separator

This is a combination of https://github.com/rpeshkov/plank-spacer and https://github.com/KeepWannabe/PlankZer with some slight tweaks.
